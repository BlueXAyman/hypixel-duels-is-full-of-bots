**So my forum got removed for breaking the rules, and I got my 2nd minor warning, but there IS NO WAY to report it despite the warning saying that I can report it...**
Here is what I wrote in the forum post.
(If you wanna comment on this just open an issue and I will leave it open for discussion)

# Hypixel Duels is Full of Bots

Greetings duels players..

I have played about 1k games in a week, and here are some interesting facts about the experience.
Now before I continue, I got a minor forum warning in January because I apparently encouraged cheating? (It will obviously affect my future staff apps because, duh, I got warned for hating cheaters and asking for a solution, that's obviously not the type of staff they are looking for) And just to make it clear, I do not condone cheating, I am against it, These are just some stats that I made so the staff know what it looks like from the inside of the duels community.

Excluding normal cheaters that get banned after few hours, I will only give stats of players that I am 100% sure are botting.
I will not give any names to not get a warning for public shaming, the player in the clip is nicked (its not a player but whatever)

Based on 1000 games played. **(Classic Duels)**
32% (325) of gams were against botters.

68% (218) of the bots were nicked. (Few of them keep changing nicks daily but I know who they are, their bot patterns are very obvious, and when they are real humans, they unnick and try to act legit to avoid bans)

7/10 of Weekly Win/Loss Classic leaderboard players are botters.

out of the 325/1000 bots, I obviously faced the sames ones many times. about 10 of them have a ranking of #100 or higher, the highest one I have faced is ranked ~#20 (Classic Wins Ranking, once again, I will not give the exact ranking of the player to avoid public shaming)

90% of the reported botters have not been banned 1 week after the report (many reports).

**Now the big question is, how to beat the bots?**

The bots are easy to beat if you camp into a corner, dodge their arrows, bow them a few times (if you memorize the patterns of the bots you can land you bow hits fine), and when the bot is near you, block hit and try to crit it and rod it after every 2 hits or so. ( I failed to beat it in the video because I was laughing so hard)

In this funny clip I've taken, it just shows a nicked bot that got tricked by the wall in the map, looks like its programmer thought the duels maps have no walls, because they kind of don't.

I am not here to public shame the network, or blame the staff, but I can't help to wonder, if us the hundreds of normal players can tell the difference between a cheater, and a legit player in 10 seconds. Then what are they training the new Game Masters project that they replaced Mods with to do?, Is there not too many of them? hire more. Do they think the bots are legit players just because they move like a player (they really dont) and their reach is a perfect 3 blocks (Is it normal tho?), then train them better? or hire experienced pvp players or people who have the passion instead.
One last thing: If you, staff members are reading this and decide to remove it for (I really don't know, ive read the rules 2 times before posting this) then please put the actual reason this time.
